=== FIRST LUNAR STEPS ===

109:24:15 CDR: I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches. Although the surface appears to be very, very fine-grained as you get close to it, it's almost like a powder.

109:24:48 CDR: I'm going to step off the LM now.

109:24:48 CDR: That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

109:25:08 CDR: Yes, the surface is fine and powdery. I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers, like powdered charcoal, to the sole and sides of my boots.

109:43:16 LMP: Beautiful view!
109:43:18 CDR: Isn't that something? Magnificent sight out here.
109:43:24 LMP: Magnificent desolation.

110:16:19 CDR: That would be an honor.

110:16:30 PRESIDENT NIXON: Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.

128:03:00 CDR: We're station-keeping on the Columbia.
128:03:04 CC: Roger. Standing by for hard dock.

128:12:00 CDR: That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it strike, and then I thought things were pretty steady. I went boom with it, and that time it really caught it. It's captured.
128:12:08 CC: We copy. It's been a mighty fine day.
